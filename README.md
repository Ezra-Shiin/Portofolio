# Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Text Mining Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
This repository presents a curated collection of projects in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, highlighting my ability to design and implement end-to-end data-driven solutions—from data exploration and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

The projects span a variety of domains, including predictive analytics, computer vision, natural language processing, time-series analysis, and decision-support systems. Each project is documented with a dedicated README that explains the problem context, methodology, and key findings to support deeper understanding.
